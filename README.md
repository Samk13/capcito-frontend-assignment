# Capcito - Frontend work sample

## The assignment

You'll be provided a starter project with the markup already done. You'll focus on the JavaScript part, which isn't done at all.

When you start the project you'll see a table of users, each row has two icons to the right, a "pen" icon for editing the user, and a "trash" icon for removing the user completely.

You'll also se a "Create new user" form, with 3 different types of input. Name, Age and Email.

Your assignment is to make sure the actions (Edit, Delete & Create) works fine.

You don't have any restrictions, except changing the `public/index.html` file.

Timebox: ~3-4 hours.
